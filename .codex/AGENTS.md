# Global Codex Instructions

## Knowledge & Learning

- Repeated procedures go to `~/.codex/skills/`; reusable code tests and examples go to the snippets skill; one-off runtime state, transient errors, guesses, and secrets are discarded.

## Karpathy Core

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes.
Adapted from Andrej Karpathy's observations. Soft recommendations — apply
judgment for trivial tasks (typo fixes, obvious one-liners).

These principles bias toward **caution over speed**. They are designed to
reduce costly mistakes on non-trivial work, not to slow down simple tasks.

### 1. Think Before Coding

*Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.*

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

*Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.*

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- Before writing a long solution, check if a short one would suffice.
  Don't write 200 lines if 50 would do — but also don't rewrite working
  code retroactively just to shorten it.

Self-check: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"
If yes, simplify before submitting.

### 3. Surgical Changes

*Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.*

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style. If a linter/formatter is configured, defer to it.
  If style is unenforced, match the existing pattern unless it violates
  the linter.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

*Define success criteria. Loop until verified.*

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after."

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria allow independent loops. Weak criteria
("make it work") require constant clarification.

**Working signs:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites
due to overcomplication, clarifying questions before implementation
rather than after mistakes.
